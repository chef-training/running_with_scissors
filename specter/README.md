# Specter

A web service written in Ruby using the Sinatra (web) and ActiveSupport (database) libraries.

## Background

I wanted to use Ruby to setup a web service that is able to accept a JSON document and then display all that content. I built a RESTful interface that is similar to what you might find using Rails.

## Setup

```
$ install ruby
$ /opt/local/bin/gem install bundler
$ cd PROJECT_DIR
$ /opt/local/bin/bundle install
$ /opt/local/bin/rackup
```
